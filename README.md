# Memory-Game

5th Assignment for Appleseed's Academy Coding Bootcamp (Week 5).

In this assignment, I created a fun Memory Game!

In every game, the cards are generated dynamically and the user can choose a preferable theme to play with.

The assignment is based on the following subjects:

* JavaScript: Events handling, DOM Manipulation
* JavaScript basics: objects, functions
* jQuery
* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
